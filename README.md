# cli-challenge

Programming Challenge:

Using php, write a command line application for browsing the filesystem and reading text files. It should present the user with a Text-Based User Interface (TUI) which can be navigated with arrow keys. Use best practices for object oriented coding, and layout the application code using an MVC design pattern. However, please keep total application size to a minimum. To pass the challenge: write the program with the smallest code base that implements object oriented code and the MVC pattern while presenting the required feature set. No outside executables may be used, and no external libraries should be necessary.

Ranking methodology:

All application sources will have their comments stripped and then be ranked by file size.
After ranking we will work our way from the smallest to the largest ensuring that 
1. the code is acceptably DRY
2. Object Oriented coding principles have been followed
3. The code follows an MVC layout
4. The code runs well on a standard centos7 terminal, accepts user input correctly, handles errors correctly, and exits correctly
5. The code allows the user to browse the file system and read text files

To facilitate comment stripping, please use single line comments `//`
